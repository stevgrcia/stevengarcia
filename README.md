# Hi There! Welcome to my Github.

My name is Steven Q. Garcia, and I am a graduating fourth-year student from the Philippines, taking up a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT). I aspire to build a career in the Software Quality Assurance (QA) industry. I am eager and passionate about expanding and deepening my knowledge in software testing. I have fundamental experience in manual and functional testing and am familiar with the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), particularly the Agile model. I am currently seeking job opportunities or bootcamps to help me take the next step toward my goal of becoming a QA Tester.
